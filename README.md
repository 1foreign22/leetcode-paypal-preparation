Why?
I made this just to test myself, it's made at the most efficient way (that I could do) and it's just here so you can review and compare your code to my premade. 
This is not intented for a simple copy and paste, but I wont stop you. It's good preparation for any company interview, but it's main focus is based around PayPal their Software Engineer position using Python.
If you'd like, you may adapt this code to different coding languages. 

WARNING
It is recommended that you attempt to solve the problems by yourself before using the work provided here so you can learn from your mistakes. Try to use this only to review/compare your own work, or if you are very stuck on a problem.
