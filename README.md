### üöÄ Why this repo?

I created this repository to challenge myself, aiming for **efficiency** and **clarity** in solving LeetCode problems. You can use this to:

- üß† **Review** and **compare** your solutions with mine.
- üõ† **Adapt** the code to other languages (my solutions are in Python).
- üîç **Prepare** for coding interviews (focused on PayPal's Software Engineer position).

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:**  
It's highly recommended to attempt solving the problems **on your own** before referring to the solutions. This will help you learn from your mistakes. Use this repo as a **reference** or when you're really stuck!
